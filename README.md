# Spring Batch Demo

This is a little demo on how to use **Spring Batch**. It simulates a **tennis-shop** with data-connections to a shop-system, CRM-system and a PIM-system.

Created for a course teaching Java (Spring Framework) and Data/Business Intelligence (Power BI).

It demonstrates how Spring Batch can be used as an **ETL** tool towards data analysis (for example in Power BI) 

_Enjoy!_
